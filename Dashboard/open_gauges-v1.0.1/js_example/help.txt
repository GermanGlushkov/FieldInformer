Copy js_example/ and all its contents to the root of your web server:  htdocs/

then point your browser to:

http://localhost/js_example/gauge.html
http://localhost/js_example/bar.html
http://localhost/js_example/digital.html

Of course I use a form to fill in the values, but this could simply be any form of Javascript\Ajax
For an example of this using Mootools and Ajax see:

This should be enough to get you started, but be aware that the opengauges are for server scripting and are different 
from these examples...
