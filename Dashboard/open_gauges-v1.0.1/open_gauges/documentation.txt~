Plugs:
SWFObject : http://blog.deconcept.com/swfobject/

Need a preconfigured web server that supports PHP?
Windows:    http://apache2triad.net/
Macintosh:  http://www.mamp.info/en/index.php

If you need GPL'ed Live Flash Graphs and charts please visit:

Documentation:

Copy all the contents to your web server. SWFObject is required and is included only for simplicity.
For more information and updates to SWFObject please visit: http://blog.deconcept.com/swfobject/

Point the browser to http://localhost/php_all.html, adding any path differences of course. Your server must be running PHP for this example. View the asp_example.html for IIs or Python in ASP. I only give one example there, but using the php_all.html as a guide
you will notice not much is required to switch between different languages and servers.

IMPORTANT!
You will find flashdata.php and flashdata.asp in /flash. This file must be in this directory unless you change the path in each Flash object. If you prefer to use html and return the data using Javascript just create a flashdata.js and specify js when you add the Flash object to your page. In the case of SWFObject you would do:
 so.addVariable("exec_type", "js");
To use ASP you would do:
 so.addVariable("exec_type", "asp");

PHP is the default and does not need to be set if you're planning on using PHP...

IMPORTANT!

To separate data, like in the instance you have two of the same gauge using different data, you must set the funcName var, for example: 

so.addVariable("funcName", "pgauge_data"); 

What happens:

I say use asp when the page loads, so.addVariable("exec_type", "asp");
The Flash object sends funcName, so.addVariable("funcName", "pgauge_data"); to flashdata.asp. 
pgauge_data function returns a standard HTTP string back.

What if I don't want to use SWFObject?

In that case do the usual for a Flash object. Be aware, IE will require a user click before tooltips will work. SWFObject eliminates this issue. Also, all vars will need to be appended to the source string using object/embed:
value="flash/pgauge.swf?funcName=pgauge_data&title=test&title_color=etc..." SWFOject majorly cleans that as you can see by the examples. Yes, I do really like SWFObject! Anyway, here is an example if you're not convinced:
  
		<div>
		<!- Flash Gauge Embedded -->
		    <object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000"
		    codebase="http://fpdownload.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=8,0,0,0"
		    width="195" id="percent_gauge" align="top">
		    <param name="allowScriptAccess" value="sameDomain" />
			
	            <!- IMPORTANT, this is the function, funcName=pgauge_data, in flashdata. -->
		    <param name="movie" value="flash/pgauge.swf?funcName=pgauge_data&title=test" /> 
		    <param name="menu" value="false" />
		    <param name="quality" value="high" />
		    <param name="wmode" value="transparent" />
		    <param name="bgcolor" value="#ffffff" />
			
			<!- IMPORTANT, this is the function, funcName=pgauge_data, in flashdata. -->
		    <embed src="flash/pgauge.swf?funcName=pgauge_data&title=test"
		    menu="false" quality="high" wmode="transparent" bgcolor="#ffffff"
		    width="195" name="percent_gauge" align="top"
		    allowScriptAccess="sameDomain" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"
		    pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer" />
		    </object>
		<!- Flash Gauge Embedded -->
		</div>

Resizing smaller should work ok if you don't over do. This can be done when embedding the object. Sizing up will yield bad results in most cases.
