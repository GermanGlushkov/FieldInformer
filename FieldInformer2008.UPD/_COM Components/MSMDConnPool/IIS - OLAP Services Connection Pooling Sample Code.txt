Subject:	IIS - OLAP Services Connection Pooling Sample Code
Here is sample code to implement connection pooling in ASP pages.

Many users have noted performance issues for ASP pages working with OLAP Services.  The attached code includes a VB component that does the pooling, and sample code for global.asa and an asp script.  The Session OnStart, OnEnd methods implement reference counting for a "ConnPool" object maintained by the Application object.  When the last Application object times out (by default 20 minutes), all pooled connections are destroyed.  Inside your ASP page, instead of always creating a new connection, you would write:

	set m_ConnPool = Application.StaticObjects( "m_ConnPool" )
	set con = m_ConnPool.GetConnectionFromPool( szConnectionString )
	... work with the established ADO connection
	m_ConnPool.ReturnConnectionToPool con

The long-term solution is OLE DB connection pooling.  Version 7.0 does not fully support connection pooling, so it is disabled.  PSS engineers have a KnowledgeBase (KB) article that explains how to experiment with the OLE DB connection pooling flags in the registry.

The code is generic and should work for other providers as well, but it was tested only with Plato (provider=msolap).
If you discover problems please let me know so we can improve this sample.

Thanks,
