            href="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-list/2002-December/003961.html">announced 
            Gtk# 0.6</A>. This new release includes many new features and bug 
            fixes, and is the perfect companion to the <A 
            href="http://go-mono.org/archive/mono-0.17">Mono 0.17</A> release. 
            <P>Johannes has contributed a Windows-ready package of Mono 0.17, 
            and its available from our <A

            href="http://go-mono.org/download.html">here</A>. 
            <P>Many new features as well as plenty of bug fixes. Many new 
            System.Data providers and a more mature System.Web (ASP.NET) which 
            can now be hosted in any web server. A simple <A 
            href="http://go-mono.org/archive/xsp-0.2.tar.gz">test web server</A> 
            to host asp.net has been released as well. 
            <P>This version also integrates Neale's s390 port. 
            <P>This release also includes a new exception handling system that 
            uses the gcc exception information that vastly improves our 
            internalcall speed (15% faster mcs compilation times).

            <P>Marco has got the Mono Basic compiler up to speed (support for 
            classes, modules, expressions, object creation, method invocation, 
            local variables, and some statements). The compiler is based on the 
            work from Rafael Teixeira on MCS.

            <P>Sebastien has made all symetric ciphers functional on all 
            supported modes; All the classes in Security.Cryptography are 
            present and the X590 certificates are now in too. Jackson has been 
            working on the Security classes. 
            <P>Many bug fixes all over the place: class libraries (Dick, Piers, 
            Ville, Zoltan, Gonzalo, Dan, Atsushi, Nick, Phillip), compiler, 
            runtime engine. A big thank goes for everyone who has been providing 
            bug reports for us to track down. 
            <P>Gaurav has been working on multiple WebControls. Gonzalo migrated 
            the ASP.NET engine to use POST for interaction. 
            <P>In the Gtk# land saw the integration of gda, gnome-db and 
            GStreamer bindings. 
            <P>Windows.Forms classes now build on Linux and Windows, check out

            TDS.</H2>
            <P>Today Neal Ferguson's support for the IBM S390 was checked into 
            CVS. 
            <P>The XSP processor has been fully integrated into the System.Web 
            assembly, and Gonzalo has finished the hosting interfaces in Mono. 
            This means that it is possible to embed ASP.NET with the same APIs 
            used in Windows, and is possible to easily embed it with Apache for 
            example. The XSP module has now become a shell for testing the 
            System.Web classes. 
            <P>We are looking for contributors that know Win32 to contribute to 
            the Windows.Forms implementation. If you want to help write some 
            controls using the Win32 API, get in touch with our new <A

            mailing list. 
            <P>Tim's TDS System.Data set of classes can now talk to SQL servers 
            using the TDS protocol (version 4.2) with connection pooling. 
            Currently it can connect, run transactions, update/insert/delete, 
            and read some types. A data adapter is also coming soon. <A

            Debugger.</H2>
            <P>Sebastien Poliot has made a lot of progress, he reports that DES 
            and TripleDES have been fixed; Rijndael and CFB modes still have 
            problems in some configurations and some areas that are not 
            supported by the .NET framework. 
            <P>Last week we created a new <A 
            href="http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/mono-winforms-list">mailing 
            list</A> to discuss the Mono Winforms implementation. 
            <P>Tim has started a full C# implementation of the TDS protocol and 
            the providers, and Brian continues his work on his ODBC binding. 
            <P>Rachel Hestilow has also checked in a binding for GConf. This 
            binding <A 
            href="http://toxic.magnesium.net/~hestilow/gconfsharp/intro.html">is 
            unique</A> in that it uses some features in the CLI to support 
            complex data types, and allows the user to keep only one 
            representation of the types instead of two (the master types is 
            defined in CLI-land). Also Property Editors (<A 
            href="http://primates.ximian.com/~miguel/shots/gconf-shot.png">shot</A>) 
            simplify the creation of user interfaces that bind their 
            configuration to backend keys, following the <A 
            href="http://developer.gnome.org/projects/gup/hig/1.0/">GNOME Human 
            Interface Guidelines.</A> 
            <P>Martin is now on vacation, but before leaving he produced a 
            number of documents detailing the state of the debugger. The major 
            missing feature is full support for debugging unmanaged applications 
            (it requires dwarf-2 handlers for types). We will do some polishing 
            of the user interface (<A 
            href="http://primates.ximian.com/~miguel/shots/debugger-4.png">new 
            shot</A>) to expose the existing and rich functionality to the users 
            and try to release a preview of the debugger at the same time as 
            Mono 0.17. 
            <P><A name=Oct14th,2002:Crypto,Databasework,Debugger,Documentation.>

            Documentation.</H2>
            <P>Brian, Daniel and Rodrigo have been busy working on the ODBC 
            provider for Mono. Daniel posted some <A 
            href="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-list/2002-October/002755.html">updates</A>. 
            Brian posted <A 
            href="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-list/2002-October/002758.html">details 
            about the ODBC.NET</A> provider. 
            <P>Also Sebastien Pouliot has been improving the various 
            cryptographic classes in Mono, something that we had not done in 
            quite some time. We are looking for a way to handle big-nums. We 
            need either a managed or unmanaged set of classes for handling large 
            numbers, and some volunteers to expose this functionality to C# 
            (Either as an internal assembly, or as a set of P/Invoke, Internal 
            call wrappers). 
            <P>Martin has got our debugger to support adding breakpoints at 
            file/line combos. This was more complex than generic breakpoints in 
            routines, because these breakpoints are set on routines that 
            probably have not been JITed just yet. Martin's focus now is on 
            stabilizing our debugger and aim for a public release of it. 
            <P>We have also imported the ECMA documentation into a separate 
            module, and with the help from Scott Bronson we will have the 
            necessary XSLT tools to finish our native documentation browser for 
            Mono. This together with the work from Adam will be the foundation 
            for the <A href="http://go-mono.org/classlib-doc.html">Mono 
            Documentation Tools</A>.

            <H2>Oct 9th, 2002: Various Mono updates.</H2>
            <P>Brian Ritchie, Daniel Morgan, Rodrigo Moya and Ville Palo have 
            been working on various database providers. The MySQL has seen a lot 
            of work, and a new ODBC provider is now on CVS and more extensive 
            regression tests have been checked in. 
            <P>Dick Porter is our background hero and keeps fixing the low-level 
            bugs in the portability layer. Now the Mono handle daemon should be 
            a lot more robust and will no longer leave IPC regions. Gonzalo 
            Paniagua has initiated the migration of XSP into the System.Web 
            class libraries now that we have a complete HttpRuntime 
            implementation. This means that you are able to embed the ASP.NET 
            processor into any web server you want. This also includes support 
            for the system-wide configuration file `machine.config'. 
            <P>Martin Baulig has been busy with the Mono Debugger, you can see 
            how it looks <A 
            href="http://primates.ximian.com/~miguel/debugger-1.png">here</A> 
            and <A 
            href="http://primates.ximian.com/~miguel/debugger-2.png">here</A>. 
            Now local variables and breakpoints are supported, and we are 
            working on the UI elements to simplify their use (as seen on the 
            screenshot). 
            <P><A href="http://gtk-sharp.sf.net/">Gtk#</A> has seen a lot of 
            activity specially as we start to build larger applications. 
            Vladimir Vukicevic, Kristian Rietveld, Rachel Hestilow, Mike Kestner 
            and Miguel de Icaza have been busy improving it. mPhoto which is a 
            Photo management application for Mono and Gtk# is seen <A

            <P>Chris Toshok the man behind LDAP in Evolution continues to work 
            on the Mono.LDAP# implementation. 
            <P>Dietmar Maurer and Paolo Molaro are still busy working on our new 
            optimized JIT/ATC engine and are making great progress. The code 
            base has been designed to ease the implementation of more advanced 
            compiler optimizations, and optimizations can be chosen individually 
            so they can be tuned for a particular processor, or use 
            profile-based information to improve the performance.

            <H2>Sep 17th, 2002: Mono Hackers Hall of Fame: Sergey Chaban </H2>
            <P>The <A href="http://go-mono.org/hackers.html">Mono Hackers Hall 
            Of Fame</A> continues to show our appreciation to the excellent 
            contributors that made <B>mono::</B> a successful free software 
            project. 
            <P>This time the Hall of Fame welcomes Sergey Chaban. Sergey has 
            been a long time contributor to the project, from the early work on 
            the class libraries that were critical to Mono's origin: every time 
            you use a Hashtable in Mono, it runs Sergey's code, to the low-level 
            optimizations on the JIT engine and to his work on ILASM and the 
            PEToolkit. 
            <P><A

            <H2>Sep 16th, 2002: Documentation Tools, ILASM, Debugger, Mono LDAP, 
            Winforms</H2>
            <P>Adam Treat has started moving the documentation universe again. 
            We have a new strategy to document our APIs (given that we have 
            chosen <A href="http://go-mono.org/classlib-doc.html">not to 
            document the code inline</A>). This includes the use of a master 
            reference file that will hold the entry points to document. All 
            master files for our assemblies have been checked into CVS now. 
            <P>Sergey Chaban's Mono.PEToolkit and ILASM tools have been checked 
            into CVS. Although ILASM is old and will soon be updated, we wanted 
            to get the build issues sorted out. 
            <P>Martin Baulig's Mono Debugger is still on its early stages, but 
            you can run and run step by step your C# code and C code (including 
            the Mono runtime). Dwarf-2 is required to compile your code. The 
            regular step, step-into, and assembly-level step and step-into are 
            supported. And comes with a Gtk# UI. The debugger is written mostly 
            in C# with some C glue code. Most of the work is on the engine, we 
            will be working on making a good UI in the future. 
            <P>Chris Toshok of the Hungry Programmer's fame has checked in 
            Mono.Directory.LDAP, a C# wrapper for the LDAP libraries. This is 
            the substrate for implementing the System.DirectoryServices 
            assembly. 
            <P>Andrew has also continued with some of the cryptographic classes 
            implementation. 
            <P>After much public debate, we have chosen a new <A 
            href="http://go-mono.org/winforms.html">strategy to implement 
            winforms</A>. Implementing a Gtk, Qt or Aqua based version of 
            Winforms was going to be almost as complex as implementing Wine 
            itself. So the new strategy is to only roll out a WineLib-based 
            implementation.

            <P>Rhys Weatherley has contributed the Portable.NET encoders to the 
            Mono class libraries. This is a great step towards cooperation 
            between these projects. Thanks to Paolo for doing the merger on our 
            side. 
            <P>His encoders are more complete than the iconv-based approach that 
            mono used, which was unreliable under certain circumstances.

            <P>Mark Crichton has checked in his patches to get the SPARC port on 
            par with the PPC port. 
            <P>Dick has checked-in the resource reader and resource writers to 
            the class libraries, and Dietmar checked in the C# support code for 
            the remoting infrastructure. 
            <P>More work on System.Data: the LibGDA (our OleDB backend) based 
            providers are quickly maturing, and recently they executed their 
            first query.

            ADO.NET</H2>
            <P>Martin Baulig has been fixing all the known bugs in the C# 
            compiler and now has moved into improving the compilation speed and 
            the generated code quality of MCS. Today we got a 50% speedup in the 
            bootstrap of MCS going from 24 seconds to 12 seconds. 
            <P>Gtk# has been making a lot of progress, some interesting corner 
            cases are now supported:, you can now create canvas items as well as 
            using the tree widget. Here is a shot of <A 
            href="http://go-mono.org/images/mocil.png">MonoCIL</A>. 
            <P>On the runtime front, focus has been on improving remoting 
            support, exception handling, as well as completing the support for 
            structure marshaling. 
            <P>Patrik is also back in action: the HttpRuntime infrastructure is 
            rapidly improving, and Gonzalo is working into moving XSP into our 
            main class library and providing the missing pieces to integrate 
            with Patrik's code. 
            <P>Dennis and his team are working on a WineLib-based implementation 
            of Windows Forms to guarantee that the corner cases of Windows.Forms 
            can be handled, and we are back on track again. 
            <P>A lot more work on the ADO.NET and WebServices has also been 
            checked into CVS.

            software project. 
            <P>The first, deserved, entry goes to Nick Drochak, who joined us in 
            the first days of Mono and built the testing infrastructure for the 
            C# assemblies, fixed tons of bugs and even adventured himself in the 
            lands of the C runtime. His work is invaluable for keeping Mono on

              prototype written using Windows.Forms, but we believe it will be 
              faster to have this done using ASP.NET (and it is also a nice way 
              of stress testing it).

            <P>Paolo today got mono to complete host itself on Linux. This means 
            that we can now compile the `corlib' using the Mono C# compiler and 
            the Mono runtime. 
            <P>Compiling the corlib was rather tricky, because the types that 
            the compiler uses during the compilation process will come from the 
            source code it is compiling. 
            <P>After a few months of work, we have finally fleshed out all the 
            remaining bugs. Now the next step is to update the makefiles to 
            compile with the Mono tool-chain. 
            <P>A recapitulation:

              <LI>The Mono runtime matured enough by March 12, 2002 that it was 
              able to bootstrap the Mono C# compiler on Linux using our 
              interpreter. This means that our development tool was self 
              sufficient. 
              <P></P>
              <LI>On March 26th, the JIT engine was fixed, so we could use this 
              to run the compiler on Linux. 
              <P></P>
              <LI>Martin fixed the remaining bugs in the compiler that stopped 
              it from compiling the `corlib'. The resulting image still 
              contained errors though. 
              <P></P>
              <LI>On July 8th, Radek got the PowerPC port to bootstrap the C# 
              compiler. This is important, because it exposed various tricky 
              issues in a big-endian system. 
              <P></P>
              <LI>Today: we can bootstrap the compiler using libraries and the 
              compiler compiled with itself on Linux. The process is complete. 
              </LI></UL>
            <P>In the meantime, Dietmar has quietly implemented the remaining 
            pieces of Marshalling in the Mono runtime. This is very important 
            for the Gtk# guys to move on with their bindings. 
            <P>To make things more interesting, he replaced most of the 
            architecture specific code generation for trampolines (delegates, 
            invocations, function and p/invoke trampolines) to use CIL. This CIL 
            is then compiled on the flight by the JIT Compiler engine. By doing 
            this, we have reduced the burden to port the JITer to new 
            architectures, and that our trampoline code is cross platform. 
            <P><A name=Jul9th,2002>
            <H2>Jul 9th, 2002</H2>
            <P>Ajay was the first to notice <A 
            href="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-list/2002-July/000641.html">Mono's 
            first birthday</A>. 
            <P>In a year, we have achieved plenty: 
            <UL>
              <LI>94 contributors with CVS access (84 non-Ximian developers). 
              <LI>A complete CLI implementation: 
              <UL>
                <LI>A fast and performing x86 JIT engine (inlining, constant 
                propagation). 
                <LI>An interpreter for other systems (PPC, Sparc, StrongArm). 
                </LI></UL>
              <LI>A self-hosting C# compiler, which can compile its class 
              libraries. 
              <LI>37,140 file changes in CVS. 
              <LI>92,000 lines of C code. 
              <LI>437,000 lines of C# code (compiler, classes, tests) 
              <LI>A working core for ASP.NET and ADO.NET. 
              <LI>Major subsystems are functional: RegularExpressions, 
              System.XML, XML.Schema, System.Data, System.Web. 
              <LI>The Gtk# project, which is maturing rapidly. </LI></UL>
            <P>Thanks to everyone who has made Mono possible with their 
            feedback, regression tests, their comments, their help on the 
            mailing list, code contributions, complete classes, bug reporting, 
            the countless hours of bug hunting. This project would not have been 
            possible without every contribution. 
            <P>It has been a great year for everyone involved in the project. I 
            think we have built a new and exciting community. 
            <P>Now we have a solid foundation to build on, so this next year 
            looks even more exciting: not only because we will see more Mono 
            applications, but we will begin using Mono as an `library' to be 
            linked with applications that want to get scripting-like features; 
            Gtk# is our ticket to create nice GNOME applications; And we will be 
            developing CORBA bindings to integrate with other object systems. 
            <P>Also, for those interested in optimizations and tuning, this year 
            we will get to play with more advanced optimizations and all kinds 
            of interesting research ideas for improving Mono code generation. 
            <P>A special thanks to the Mono developers at Ximian for managing to 
            survive their manager and a special thanks to our regression test 
            marshal Nick Drochak, who has been hunting down, and fixing code in 
            our class libraries and keeping us on track for so long. 
            <P><A name=Jul8th,2002>
            <H2>Jul 8th, 2002</H2>
            <P>Radek today fixed the last bugs to get Mono to self host on 
            Linux/PowerPC. 
            <P>Alp Toker has released version 0.5 of <A 
            href="http://www.atoker.com/phonic/">Phonic</A>, a media player for 
            .NET. Phonic makes extensive use of Mono-developed technologies such 
            as Gtk# and csvorbis (Ogg player ported by Mark). Hopefully we will 
            be seeing many more exciting applications like these in the near 
            future. 
            <P>Dietmar has been moving a lot of the architecture specific code 
            in the JIT engine to our internal representation. This means that 
            porting the JIT is simpler now, as there is less 
            architecture-specific code to maintain. The inliner, constant folder 
            and constant propagation are also done at the architecture 
            independent layer. 
            <P>Gonzalo is now running the sample ASP.NET applications on Linux 
            with the Mono runtime. It still needs polishing though, and help 
            with the various ASP.NET controls would be appreciated. The ASP.NET 
            community seems more poor than the PHP community, we need to have a 
            few open source controls to do things dynamic rendering 
            (libart+gdk-pixbuf again can do most of the work), charts and 
            components like the kind of thing you see in the PHP universe: to 
            bring nice GPL code to the masses of Windows developers, lure them 
            into the world of Linux. 
            <P>Dick has also got us the new Process implementation that 
            implements the Win32 semantics. Now only redirection is missing.

            <P>Martin Baulig fixed the remaining bugs that prevented MCS to 
            compile our corlib. The compilation was tricky because of the way 
            MCS bootstraps the compile (internally mcs uses the types that are 
            being defined at that point to perform compares). 
            <P>Martin and Paolo have been working hard on fixing the remaining 
            issues. Currently 102 test pass and 15 fail with our resulting 
            corlib. 
            <P>Jesus' SoapFormatter classes are now in CVS. 
            <P>I have been redoing the type lookup system for MCS. The 
            interesting bit is that I did most of this work on an airplane using 
            MCS itself. Which is a good test that the compiler is now a good 
            development tool. 
            <P>Duncan, Mike and Rachel have been hard at work with Gtk#, now 
            there are bindings for the GtkHTML widget (the one used by 
            Evolution's composer). And Rachel also got the beginning of GNOME 
            bindings, that should simplify application development. 
            <P>A big thanks goes to Dennis Hayes for getting the Windows.Forms 
            work together, and committing so many stubs for Windows.Forms.

            <P>I am updating the Mono site from the UNESCO offices in Uruguay, 
            the <A 
            href="http://www.gnome.org/resources/calendar/roadshow/GNOMEenelSur.html">South-America 
            trip</A> to promote free software is going very well. 
            <P>Many news in Mono-land this week so far: 
            <P>Mike Kestner got bindings for GtkHTML last night for Gtk#, this 
            is using GtkHTML 2.0. 
            <P>On Monday Piers Haken <A 
            href="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-list/2002-June/000380.html">contributed</A> 
            the core to support XPath in Mono: most of the w3c spec is 
            implemented (modulo a few pending bits). 
            <P>Dick checked in his implementation of the Process classes: 
            process forking and waiting support committed, with some functions 
            to query status. This was complex as we had to emulate the Win32 
            environment, but this is another step to be fully compatible. This 
            means for example that any process can check on the status of any 
            other process (without the parent/child relationship) 
            <P>Of course, those interested in only the Unix semantics can always 
            P/Invoke the Unix calls.

            <P>Mono's ASP.NET has rendered its first page on Linux for the first 
            time (Gonzalo and Paolo). 
            <P>Also, we are getting close to self hosting. Paolo posted a <A 
            href="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-list/2002-June/000345.html">list 
            of pending issues</A> which are now very small. 
            <P>Steam is picking up in <A 
            href="http://gtk-sharp.sf.net/">Gtk#</A> as the bindings become more 
            complete and small applications are starting to emerge. Gtk# now 
            compiles completely on Linux. This uses a lot of the XML libraries, 
            which is nice to see.

            all Html Controls, and 21 out of the 26 Web Controls. Session 
            tracking is next. Look in xsp/test for a collection of tests that 
            render with Mono. 
            <P>Ajay has been very busy improving and extending the

            <P>Rodrigo Moya announced <A 
            href="http://lists.ximian.com/archives/public/mono-list/2002-May/005366.html">new 
            LibGDA</A>: LibGDA is an ADO-like library for Unix systems. This one 
            removes all the CORBA and GConf dependencies, which should make it 
            easier to use and compile. 
            <P>This is another milestone for our <A 
            href="http://go-mono.org/ado-net.html">ADO.NET implementation 
            plans</A> 
            <P>We have a little surprise for everyone tracking the news on 
            Tuesday ;-)

            <P>Mark Crichton csvorbis port (C# port of Vorbis player) and 
            Richard Hestilow's <A href="http://monologo.sf.net/">MonoLogo 
            compiler</A> are now on the CVS, and you can get them from AnonCVS. 
            <P>Dick implemented inter-process sharing of handles as well as 
            simplifying the implementation of WaitForMultipleObjects, now we 
            have a `handles' subsystem in Mono. This is needed to fully emulate 
            the handle behavior that Win32 exposes, and that the .NET API expose 
            to applications.

            <P>Some updates from the hacking lines: 
            <P><B>The web:</B> Patrik Torstensson last week contributed the http 
            runtime support and started work on thread pools. This is part of 
            the ASP.NET support. 
            <P><B>Docs:</B> John Barnette, John Sohn and Adam Treat have been 
            hacking on MonoDoc. 
            <P><B>ADO.NET:</B> Daniel Morgan and Rodrigo Moya have been working 
            on the <A href="http://go-mono.org/ado-net">ADO.NET</A> support, and 
            got the first signs of life this week (we can connect, insert rows; 
            do transactions: commit/rollback; SQL errors and exceptions work). 
            Check <A 
            href="http://go-mono.org/mailing-lists.html">mono-patches</A> for 
            all the goodies. 
            <P><B>Optimizations:</B> A number of optimizations in the runtime 
            made the compiler twice as fast this week: 
            <P>Early this week Patrik started the string rewrite in the runtime. 
            Today Dietmar finished the constructors and deployed the new layout. 

            <P>Paolo got the JIT engine to generate profiles, which were in turn 
            used to find hot spots in Reflection, which he improved. 
            <P>Daniel Lewis (of Regex fame) noticed the performance issues with 
            our current array layout, and contributed a new array 
            representation. 
            <P>At the same time Dietmar started the the JIT inline code and 
            implemented constant propagation. These two optimizations together 
            are very powerful. 
            <P><B>Bug fixing:</B> And of course everyone has been helping out 
            with the bug fixing (Duncan, Gonzalo, Jonathan, Miguel, Nick, Ravi, 
            Sergey) 
            <P>

            <H2>Apr 18, 2002</H2>
            <P>Dietmar's inlining for the JIT engine just landed into CVS. This 
            is only a first cut and more improvements will come later. 
            <P>Patrik, Paolo, Dietmar and Gonzalo have been busy optimizing our 
            class libraries and runtime engine to become faster. Many changes on 
            CVS as well.

            .NET Remoting</A> from Ingo Rammer is now available. Ingo helped us 
            to implement the proxy support and the book is a valuable resource 
            for anyone interested in remoting.

            <H2>Apr 5, 2002</H2>
            <P>Transparent proxy support has been finished, congrats to Dietmar. 
            Our JIT engine on CVS contains the implementation. This should 
            enable people to test the remoting framework on Mono.

            Martin's work. The resulting dwarf file can be used to single step 
            C# code in GDB. A document will be shortly published with the

            <P>Paolo finally fixed the last bug in the JITer that stopped us

            <P>Martin has been working on our debugging infrastructure, both on 
            the JIT side of things (adding dward support) as well as on the 
            class libraries (so that MCS can start generating debugging 
            information). Jason and Kral keep working on the System.Xml 
            namespace, allowing Mike to move more to self-hosting his Gtk# code. 

            <P>The System.Web classes are now part of the build (and they are 
            also part of the class status now). Ajay contributed a large chunk 
            of code to the System.Xml.Schema namespace 
            <P>Dan (of regex fame) has been working on internal calls support: 
            moving more code from the old monowrapper to become internal calls. 
            <P>Paolo and Dietmar are working steadily on our runtime 
            environment, fixing bugs, adding missing features and allowing us to 
            run the compiler on Linux. 
            <P>Remember to post your bug reports. 
            <P>The nice class status on the right is brought to you by endless 
            hacking hours from Piers and Nick. These status report pages have 
            been helping us track down various mistakes in our classes (very 
            useful, check it out for yourself)

            <P>At midnight, in Italy, Paolo got the Mono C# compiler to self 
            host on Linux, the last bug has been squashed to self hostingness. 
            We have now a fully self hosting compiler in Linux. 
            <P>A release will follow up shortly.

            compiler compiling itself on Linux</A> completely for the first 
            time! The resulting image still contains some errors, but the whole 
            compiler process goes now. Later in the day and a couple of small 
            optimizations and bug fixes, the compile speed was improved in 400% 
            <P>We are very close to have a complete self hosting environment 
            now. 
            <P>Mono is temporarily using the Bohem GC garbage collector while we 
            deploy the more advanced ORP one.

            <P>We would like to welcome all the new developers that have joined 
            the project in the last couple of days. The classes are rapidly 
            moving.

            and Mono</A>. 
            <P>Nick is still leading our test suite platform. I can not stress 
            how important it is to have a good regression test suite for our 
            platform, as buggy class libraries are what are stopping the 
            compiler from running completely on Linux. 
            <P>We are of course psyched to see Mono run on non-Linux systems. 
            Work is moving on native code generation for StrongARM, PowerPC, and 
            SPARC as well as porting Mono to other systems.

            Internet Server') that is mostly used to test our IO layer, a <A 
            href="http://primates.ximian.com/~miguel/dick-mis-server.png">screenshot</A> 

            <P>Paolo and Dietmar are busy making our runtime self sufficient on 
            non-Windows platforms. 
            <P>C# compiler front: A lot of focus in the past weeks after the C# 
            became self hosting has been in making the compiler a useful tool 
            for development: improve error handling, provide better error 
            reports, fixing all known bugs, and finally profiling of the 
            compiler has begun.

            <P>Our compiler has been self-supporting since January 3rd. In the 
            meantime, we have been busy working on making it run on Linux. Today 
            Paolo got more work done on Reflection.Emit and the compiler 
            compiled `console.cs' (a sample Mono program) on Linux.

            <P>Mono C# compiler becomes self-sufficient. We can now continue 
            development of the compiler with itself. 
            <P>Work on the class libraries is still underway for having a full 
            self hosting system. We hope to achieve our goal of self-hosting on 
            Linux before the end of the month.

            <P>After a lot of work, the C# compiler can compile itself. There 
            are still errors in the generated image, but they are being fixed 
            quickly.

            <P>JIT: More work on our IO abstraction layer (Dick). 
            <P>JIT: exception handling for unmanaged code (Dietmar) 
            <P>System.Reflection: Support for PropertyInfo and PropertyBuilder 
            as well as the various queries for MethodBase. 
            <P>C#: Pre-processor; Rewrite of MemberLookup which fixed many of 
            the outstanding issues. More bug fixing allows it to compile more 
            programs.

            <P>Dietmar has improved the register allocation and now Mono 
            performs two to three times as fast as it did yesterday. Amazing. 
            <P>The compiler keeps moving along, explicit interface 
            implementation is there.

            <H2>Dec 11, 2001</H2>
            <P>The JIT engine can now run all the compiler regression tests as 
            well as assorted other programs, many more opcodes added recently. 
            Currently the JIT engine uses a very simplistic register allocator 
            (just enough to allow us to focus on feature completeness) and that 
            will be the next major task to improve performance and reduce spills 
            and reloads. 
            <P>On the C# compiler front: language features are now pretty much 
            complete. The big missing tasks are unsafe code support, visibility, 
            explicit interface implementation plus static flow analysis. There 
            are many small bugs that need to be addressed. 
            <P>You can get your copy of the <A 
            href="http://go-mono.org/snapshots">latest Mono</A> 
            <P>More work is also required on fixing the foundation class 
            libraries, it is easy to find spots now since Nick got the `make 
            test' going.

            switch statement as well as fixing many existing bugs. Many new more 
            tests. Nick keeps working on improving our class library test suite.

              <P>To sum things up: The Mono C# compiler is written in C# and 
              uses the .NET classes to get its work done. To make this work on 
              Linux work has to happen in various fronts: 
              <UL>
                <LI>The C# compiler is being worked on and can compile many 
                programs now (our test suite at this point is made up of 40 
                tests). 
                <P></P>
                <LI>The class libraries need to be mature enough to support the 
                compiler, particularly System.Reflection.Emit (which is what 
                Paolo has been working on lately). 
                <P>The compiler currently requires 103 classes from the .NET 
                runtime (you can get the list by running: <B>monodis --typeref 
                mcs.exe</B> 
                <P></P>
                <LI>The interpreter should be mature enough to run the actual 
                compiler byte codes and the corlib bytecodes. </LI></UL>

            <BLOCKQUOTE>Lots of classes for System.Web from Gaurav were 
              committed this morning. 
              <P>Some large recent developments: 
              <P>The Decimal implementation from Martin Weindel has been 
              partially integrated (we need to put the internalcalls in place 
              now and compile and link the decimal code). 
              <P>Derek Holden committed recently the IntegerFormatter code into 
              the CVS, so we got a pretty comprehensive integer formatting 
              engine that we can finally use all over the place. 
              <P>Compiler got support for lock as well as assorted bug fixes. 
              Ravi is still working on array support (and then we can optimize 
              foreach for the array case). 
              <P>Dietmar is busy working on flow analysis on the JITer, the 
              previous mechanism of generating the forest was wrong. Paolo has 
              been a busy bee reworking the System.Reflection.Emit support code, 
              and we should have some pretty nice stuff next week. Dick on the 
              other hand is still working on the WaitOne/WaitAll emulation code. 
              WaitAll is like select on steroids: it can wait for different 
              kinds of objects: files, mutexes, events and a couple of others. 
              <P>Mike Kestner is busy working on Gtk# which is now using the 
              .defs files to quickly wrap the API. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>

            <BLOCKQUOTE>JIT engine supports many of the object constructs now 
              (object creation, vtable setup, interface table setup). 
              <P>The C# compiler now has almost full property support (only 
              missing bit are pre-post increment/decrement operations), 
              delegates are now created (still missing delegate invocation). 
              try/catch/finally is also supported in the compiler now.

            <BLOCKQUOTE>Our System.Reflection.Emit implementation created its 
              first executable today. This means that a very simple .NET program 
              that was compiled on Windows was able to generate a .NET program 
              while running on Linux using the Mono runtime. 
              <P>The various piece of the puzzle are starting to get together: 
              the compiler can compile simple programs now and we are basically 
              focusing on completeness now. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
